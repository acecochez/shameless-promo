## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Expand the image
- Access the links using the buttoms

## My process

### What I learned

I refined my knowledge in CSS styling, specifically experimenting with the "expand image" feature where I integrate some JavaScript to
change the style of elements so the expanded image opens in a modal format.

I also added a tooltip element to indicate where the image can be expanded. These two elements allowed me to experiment
with visibility in CSS.
